# Exercise 1 & 2: FibSurname.py
In week one, we were introduced to running our first python program and asked to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n is the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers.  With my first name being Claire, I was tasked with finding the 8th Fibonacci number.

In week 2, I was tasked with using a program with a string variable, changing the string variable to contain my surname 'Drummond', and rerun the program.  A task this week was to explain what ord() does. The ord() and chr() are exactly the opposite/reverse functions of each other.  We know that computer understands only bits and bytes. The characters we type in or feed into it are really encoded as bits. For us humans, we interpret these bits as some numbers that represent those characters we fed. These are what we call ASCII codes.  ASCII code for ‘A’ is 65, ‘a’ is 97, etc. ord().  It gives the ASCII code of the character.  Eg: ord(‘a’) is 97. chr(). It gives the corresponding character for given ASCII code. Eg: chr(97) is ‘a’.

# Exercise 3: Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.  THe purpose of this exercise was to write a python program that showed this to be true

# Exercise 4: Project Euler Problem No. 5
2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.  The task here is to write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.
While I have written the code using for and range, it takes a long time for the program to process.  I have found very clever python code on Github which can run the program in less than a second. https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/blob/master/python/p005.py

# Exercise 5: Iris Data Set
In this exercise I was tasked with importing the Iris Data Set and writing a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set, https://pyformat.info/
