# Exercise Week 1 & Week 2: FibSurname.py
In week one, we were introduced to running our first python programme and asked to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n is the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers.  With my first name being Claire, I was tasked with finding the 8th Fibonacci number.

In week 2, I was tasked with using a program with a string variable, changing the string variable to contain my surname 'Drummond', and rerun the programme.  A task this week was to explain what ord() does. The ord() and chr() are exactly the opposite/reverse functions of each other.  We know that computer understands only bits and bytes. The characters we type in or feed into it are really encoded as bits. For us humans, we interpret these bits as some numbers that represent those characters we fed. These are what we can say ASCII codes.  ASCII code for ‘A’ is 65, ‘a’ is 97, etc. ord().  It gives the ASCII code of the character.  Eg: ord(‘a’) is 97. chr(). It gives the corresponding character for given ASCII code. Eg: chr(97) is ‘a’.

Project Euler Problem No. 5: current solution takes too long to run.  Is it possible to find a solution where the program will run quicker?
